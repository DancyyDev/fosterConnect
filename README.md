# Foster Connect
 I wanted to create an app where those in the Foster Care System could have a goal tracker that would enble them to be independent and be able to have the skills and tools needed for adulthood.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JS, EXPRESS, MONGODB, REACT 

I had made this wtih mainly backend and it allows for the "Parent" to sign up with the "student email" and then the Student or Parent would be able to check off what goals were reached. But the Parent Login would be able to add new goals, change them, and delete them as they would see fit.

## Optimizations

Currently its just a basic models of EJS, JS and CSS but I plan on working on this project until I am satisfied! I love the abilty to make a goal checker because I know that everone in the Foster Care System wishes for independacny and fredom from the System.

## Lessons Learned:

It was definately fun (so far)  to be able to have one account make a goal tracker. Cant wait to make itt so the "Kid" can check on what needs to be done and then comeplete some of the tasks!
